Got it — you want a **Day 1 assignment** where students create a simple **Newspaper Article Page** using **only 3 TextView components** (NO buttons, NO logic, NO Java changes).

Here is the clean, simple assignment exactly as needed:

---

# 📰 **DAY 1 Assignment — Newspaper Article Page (Using 3 TextViews)**

### **Objective:**

Create a simple newspaper-style article layout using **ONLY TextView components** in `activity_main.xml`.

---

# ✅ **TASK**

Design a mobile screen that looks like a basic newspaper article using:

### ✔ **TextView 1 → Title**

Bold, large text (e.g., “Breaking News!”)

### ✔ **TextView 2 → Subtitle**

Smaller but noticeable text (e.g., “Local student builds first Android App!”)

### ✔ **TextView 3 → Article Body**

3–4 lines of dummy paragraph text.

**NOTE:**
No Java code changes required
No images
No buttons
Only XML editing

---

# 📘 **Sample Output Layout (Students must recreate something like this):**

```
Breaking News!
Local student builds first Android App!
Today, students started their Android journey by creating
their first Hello World application inside Android Studio.
The training will continue for 22 days with daily practice.
```

# 📝 **Requirements**

Students MUST:

✔ Use **3 TextViews**
✔ Set different **textSize** for title, subtitle, and body

---

# 🎁 **Optional Enhancement (Not required)**
